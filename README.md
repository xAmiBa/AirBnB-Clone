## My Code

During the development of this project, me and my team members learned the following:

- **Web Development**: Advanced CSS transitions and styling. HTML templates rendering.

- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL configuration and queries.

- **Session Management**: The project involved user authentication and session management with Flask, allowing users to log in and log out.

- **Files upload**: Files upload configured with Flask.

- **Form Handling**: I learned how to handle user input through forms and validate user information.

- **Testing**: Implemented end-to-end testing for your application using Playwright to ensure its functionality.

- **Collaboration**: This project was a group effort, which helped me to practice collaborative coding and version control using tools like Git.

To run this application on your local machine, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies and configure your environment. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
