## Description

This project is an Airbnb clone that allows users to list and book accommodations. Users can sign up, log in, list their properties, view available properties, and send booking requests.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, you and your team members learned the following:

- **Web Development**: You gained practical experience in web development using Flask, a popular Python web framework.

- **Database Management**: You learned to connect and interact with a database to store user data, property listings, and booking requests.

- **Session Management**: The project involved user authentication and session management, allowing users to log in and log out.

- **Form Handling**: You learned how to handle user input through forms and validate user information.

- **HTML Templating**: You used HTML templates to create the web pages for your application, making it easy to maintain and update the user interface.

- **Testing**: You implemented end-to-end testing for your application using Playwright to ensure its functionality.

- **Collaboration**: This project was a group effort, which helped you practice collaborative coding and version control using tools like Git.

## Getting Started

To run this application on your local machine, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies and configure your environment. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
